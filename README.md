"Robot Eyes with Digital Watch Mode â€“ Button-Controlled Display".
This project implements a robotic eye animation that switches to a digital watch display when a button is pressed, designed for embedded systems using a microcontroller and an OLED display. It features real-time clock (RTC) functionality using the DS3231 module, displaying time and date on the OLED. 
  The interactive eye animations include blinking, happy eyes, sleeping, and saccade movements. A push button toggles between the RTC display and animations, while serial command input allows control of animations. 
  A demo mode automatically cycles through different eye expressions. The components used include an Arduino board (Uno, Mega, or similar), a DS3231 RTC module, an SSD1306 OLED display (I2C), and a push button for mode switching.
